# Digital-Lock
The Digital Clock is a simple web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays the current time and updates every second. It uses the Date object and setInterval() to show real-time changes dynamically. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, time formatting, and responsive design basics.
